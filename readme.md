# Personal Collection of Wallpapers

## Additional Considerations for @jajunk
I am not interested in contributing upstream. I need to adjust this project to better reflect my purposes.
- [ ] Delete the pics I don't care about.
- [ ] Add pictures I have form other repos
- [ ] Add folders for better organization
- [ ] Add my profile pictures
- [ ] Add my Banner photos
- [ ] Add folders and contents for re-usable assets.
